# Lab: 37 - React I

## React, Next.js & TailwindCSS

### Overview

React is great! And though it does A LOT, it’s not a full framework. In other words, many common tasks are not handled out of the box by React. So it’s up to us devs to make some decisions about how to use React in combination with other tools.

One great “stack” is to use Next.js (which builds on top of React) and style with Tailwind.

Your job is to create a Cookie Stand Admin app using Next.js and style using Tailwind CSS.

### Feature Tasks and Requirements

- The spec for lab is screen shot of Cookie Stand Admin Version 1
- pages/Index.js should…
    - Have <Head> component with page title set to **Cookie Stand Admin**
    - Have a header component that matches spec.
    - Have a <main> component containing <form> and a placeholder component showing JSON string of last created Cookie Stand.
    - Have a <footer> component that matches spec.
- Style app using TailwindCSS utility classes.

### Implementation Notes

- npx create-next-app –example with-tailwindcss cookie-stand-admin
- strip out unused files
    - Won’t break if they get left in, but a good practice to remove stuff you’re not using.
- Pro tip: Tailwind CSS Extension Pack

#### User Acceptance Tests

No testing required.

### Configuration
